## Purpose of the Orianna Project

The purpose of the "Orianna" project is to develop a strategy system for the financial market, focusing on the following
aspects:

1. **Strategy Development and Backtesting:** Identify and develop strategies applicable to the financial market, such as
   technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or quantitative trading strategies. Establish a backtesting framework to
   evaluate strategy effectiveness and automate trade execution.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis:** Ensure reliable data sources for the financial market, including stock prices,
   trading volumes, and financial statements. Utilize data analysis techniques such as statistical analysis or machine
   learning to identify potential trading opportunities.

3. **Trade Execution and Risk Management:** Build modules for executing trade orders while considering risk management
   strategies, such as setting stop-loss and take-profit levels to control risk and protect capital.

4. **Real-time Monitoring and Reporting:** Develop a real-time monitoring system to track market changes and strategy
   performance. Generate reports for assessing trade outcomes and performance.

5. **Security and Compliance:** Ensure compliance with financial market regulations and standards, safeguarding the
   system and user data.

6. **User Interface:** Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to configure strategy parameters, view
   backtesting results, and monitor real-time reports.

Developing the "Orianna" financial market strategy system requires a combination of technical and financial knowledge,
spanning multiple domains such as software development, data analysis, and understanding of the financial markets. Seek
relevant expertise during the development process to ensure system reliability and effectiveness.
