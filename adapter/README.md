# Adapter Module

The `adapter` directory contains adapter implementations for various external systems and services used in our
Golang-based monorepo project. Adapters are responsible for interfacing with external dependencies and translating their
data or actions into a format suitable for our application's use. This directory is organized as a collection of
standalone applications, each representing an adapter for a specific external system.

## Directory Structure

- **user**: Adapter for interfacing with the User Management System.
    - `main.go`: Main code file for the User Management System adapter.
    - `README.md`: Detailed explanation and usage instructions for the User Management System adapter.

- **database**: Adapter implementations for different databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    - `postgresql`: Adapter for PostgreSQL database.
    - `mysql`: Adapter for MySQL database.
    - ...

- **external**: Adapters for interfacing with external services or APIs.
    - `service1`: Adapter for external Service 1.
    - `service2`: Adapter for external Service 2.
    - ...

- **messaging**: Messaging service adapters (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
    - `rabbitmq`: Adapter for RabbitMQ messaging service.
    - `kafka`: Adapter for Apache Kafka messaging service.
    - ...

- **storage**: File or object storage adapters.
    - `s3`: Adapter for Amazon S3 storage.
    - `gcs`: Adapter for Google Cloud Storage.
    - ...

- **auth**: Authentication and authorization adapters, if applicable.
    - `oauth`: Adapter for OAuth2 authentication.
    - `jwt`: Adapter for JWT-based authentication.
    - ...

## Usage

Each adapter within the `adapter` directory is a standalone application that can be executed independently. To use a
specific adapter, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in its README.md file.

Example:

```bash
cd adapter/user
go run main.go
```
