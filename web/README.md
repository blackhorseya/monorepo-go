# Web Module

This directory contains the web application code for our Golang-based monorepo project. It is organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

- **assets**: Store static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **templates**: Define HTML templates used by the web application.
- **handlers**: Implement HTTP request handlers and routing logic.
- **middleware**: Define middleware functions for request processing.
- **models**: Define data models specific to the web module.
- **views**: Implement any view-specific logic.
- **static**: Compiled or minified assets for production.

## Getting Started

If you want to work on the web module, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have already set up the project and installed its dependencies.

2. Start the web development server:

    ```

3. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Development Guidelines

- Ensure that all routes are properly documented.
- Write unit tests for handlers and middleware.
- Keep the separation of concerns in mind to maintain a clean architecture.
