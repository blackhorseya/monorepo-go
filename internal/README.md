# Internal Module

The `internal` directory houses the core application logic and domain-specific code for our Golang-based monorepo
project. This module is intended for internal use and should not be directly exposed to external consumers.

## Directory Structure

- **domain**: Contains domain-driven design (DDD) components such as entities, value objects, and aggregates.
- **usecase**: Implements use cases and application-specific business logic.
- **repository**: Defines interfaces for data storage and retrieval.
- **service**: Implements service layers, if needed.
- **events**: Handles event-driven architecture components.
- **jobs**: Contains background jobs or workers, if applicable.
- **exceptions**: Custom exception handling, if required.

## Usage

The code within the `internal` module is meant to be used by other modules of the project, such as API endpoints, web
applications, or command-line tools. Ensure that you follow the principles of clean architecture and domain-driven
design when developing within this module.

## Development

If you want to contribute to the `internal` module, please follow these guidelines:

- Ensure that the domain logic is well-modeled and adheres to domain-driven design principles.
- Write unit tests for all domain logic and use cases.
- Maintain a clear separation of concerns, following clean architecture principles.
- Keep the code clean and follow best practices.
