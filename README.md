# Monorepo for Golang Project

## Introduction

This is a monorepo for a Golang-based project. It follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean
Architecture to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **cmd**: Contains the application's entry point(s) and configuration.
- **internal**: Houses the core application logic and domain-specific code.
- **pkg**: Contains reusable packages and libraries that can be used across the project.
- **api**: Defines any API-related code, such as REST endpoints or GraphQL schemas.
- **web**: Contains the web application code, if applicable.
- **db**: Includes database schema and migration scripts.
- **scripts**: Contains utility scripts for various tasks.
- **docs**: Documentation related to the project, including API documentation if applicable.
